My first Objective-C iOS development.  Waiting to fix minor issues with audioplayer before releasing on the app store.


App's main purpose is to play music depending on date of release. So first 2 options music is categorised into either  year or decade of release.

The other option compares all artists in users library against new music album releases in iTunes.  User may modify date so they can also retrieve all music released after a certain date too.

Idea is to make sure first 2 options are solid.  Also 1st version will make sure 3rd option works, however the plan going forward will be to create a new app based on this special idea.
